# PIP-FUCCI
PIP-FUCCI tool in MATLAB

## TODO
1. ~~Add SiR-DNA channel~~
2. ~~Set classifier to zero if it is the first or last cell stage~~
3. Find out the useless functions and remove
3. ~~Migrate the tool from GUIDE to new GUI options in MATLAB~~
3. Add image in GUI for visual inspection
3. Improve automatic detection
4. Enable csv loading as input, code speed gains, error debugging

## BUGS
- Undefined button actions
- Speed gains not used (pre-allocating, str2double, &&)
- GUI is created with GUIDE, which will be unsupported in the future
